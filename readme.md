# CI/CD for WSO2 API Manager

This repository provides a reference implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for managing WSO2 API Manager deployments using Jenkins and API Controller (apictl).

It demonstrates:
- How to treat APIs as code
- How to deploy only changed APIs
- How to track deployments with `vcs_config.yaml`

The pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` and uses `apictl vcs` for intelligent version tracking and deployment.
